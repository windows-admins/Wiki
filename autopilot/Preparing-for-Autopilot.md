# Intro

Windows Autopilot allows devices to be enrolled into Intune and have it set up with organizational policies, applications, wireless profiles, and certificates. This allows devices to be taken out of the box, have the end user connect to the internet, sign in with their credentials, and have a device setup in the same state as traditional imaging.

## Windows Autopilot vs Autopilot Device Preparation

There are two different methods for Autopilot. Windows Autopilot or Windows Autopilot Device Preparation. Windows Autopilot leverages a hardware hash, while Autopilot Device Preparation leverages a Entra ID user and a device preparation policy assigned to the user.

A hardware hash is a *snapshot* of the device when generated that contains hardware and Windows information about the device. This is generated by OEMs that participate in the Autopilot service. Most major OEMs take part in this program. This allows OEMs and resellers that are a Microsoft CSP Partner to register devices for organizations prior to devices arriving. Organizations that don't fall under those two pillars can gather the hardware hash through various methods that rely on physical access to the device.

At the time of writing, Autopilot Device Preparation doesn't have feature parity with Windows Autopilot.

## New Device Registration for Autopilot
Getting devices registered is the arguably the first step that is needed to be taken when preparing for Autopilot. For any amount of devices, getting the devices registered from the reseller (OEM or VAR) is going to be the most simple. They can register the devices using a group tag to allow devices to be automatically added into dynamic Entra ID groups.

Below is a table of what pricing organizations can expect from OEMs and Value Added Resellers (VAR). Organizations may have different experiences and pricing depending on the vendor, but Autopilot has been out long enough where resellers should have at least heard the word Autopilot. Also noted in the table is the OEM offers an Windows image out of the box with little to no bloatware. This ensures there is minimum third party software that is normally removed with a vanilla image.

## Existing Device Registration for Autopilot

For existing devices, there are a few automated ways that organizations can leverage. The hyperlinks link out to respective documentation or resources to configure each method.

1. Leveraging a PowerShell [Script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo/3.9).
2. Gathering the Hardware Hash that Configuration Manager gathers during Hardware Inventory via a [report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/how-to-prepare-Win10#gather-information-from-configuration-manager).
3. Having Intune gather the Hardware Hash using the convert method on an Intune [Deployment Profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/profiles#create-an-autopilot-deployment-profile).
4. Having the organization's reseller register them.
   - This method will only work if devices haven't gotten their motherboard replaced.

Let's break down Pros and Cons of each recommended method. There are other ways to reinvent the wheel, these are the supported and recommended methods to get devices registered for Autopilot.

### PowerShell Script
The PowerShell script named *Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo* gathers the hardware hash of a device and without any additional parameters, will display the hash in the terminal.

#### Installing Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo

To install the script, a PowerShell session is required. Below is a shortcut if the device is in the out of box experience to open an **administrative** command prompt. If the device has a PowerShell session, skip to the next code block.

```Dos
REM To open a PowerShell session in the Windows Out of Box Experience
Shift+F10 or Shift+Fn+F10
powershell
```
The two lines below are the commands that allow devices to keep the PowerShell Execution Policy the same but override it for only this Terminal Window.

```PowerShell
# Once in a PowerShell session
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Install-Script Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force
# Confirm any configuration changes PowerShell is asking.
```
#### Collecting the Hardware Hash

The hardware hash can be exported into a CSV or automatically registered via Entra ID credentials. It is important that if the CSV method is chosen, that the headers are kept in tact.

```PowerShell
# Running this command assumes a method to copy the CSV file is already in place.
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile "C:\HardwareHash.csv"

# Optionally append the group tag field.
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile "C:\HardwareHash.csv" -GroupTag "IT"
```

```PowerShell
# Running this command will require the PowerShell app being approved since it is a being treated as an Enterprise Application in Entra ID. This also requires the user signing into Entra ID to have permissions to register devices for Autopilot in the Intune tenant.
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Online

# Optionally add the group tag value.
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Online -GroupTag "IT"
```

### Community Tools for Autopilot
- The team at OSDeploy have created a wrapper of the *Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo* script that can populate more values that help the registration process. The documentation can be found [here](https://autopilotoobe.osdeploy.com/)


## Autopilot Device Preparation

As stated above, Autopilot Device Preparation keys off the end user signing into the device rather than a device hardware hash. It essentially does a lookup of the end user, see what tenant they belong in and pull down the necessary information for Autopilot to kick off. It then assigns the device into group(s) and thus downloads the polices, applications, and scripts the device is assigned. The steps outlined below are a summarization of the Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/device-preparation/requirements?tabs=software).

1. Create a Corporate Device Identifier in Intune by uploading a CSV containing serial number, manufacturer and model.
2. Create a Entra Security Group that will house the device preparation policy.
   - The owner of the group is **required** to be **Intune Autopilot Confidential Client** or **Intune Provisioning Client**. Regardless the app id will be *f1346770-5b25-470b-88bd-d5744ab7952c*.
3. Configure an Autopilot Device Preparation Policy
   - Make sure to assign the device group created in step 2.
4. End user that is assigned with the configuration above, signs into the device during OOBE.
